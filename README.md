# SeeSound

SeeSound is an android app to see the variations in sound amplitude picked up from Android device's microphone.
SeeSound helps people with weak hearing especially elderly or differently-abled to identify whether there is something being said to them or its just a hallucination(psychosis).


## How it works

Upon installing the app, giving record audio permissions once prompted, user will see a screen with plots of audio amplitude.

The system reads audio amplitude from microphone and normalizes it from zero to top (height) of the screen. A loud audio sample is displayed as a taller bar and a lower audio means a shorter bar on the charts.

## Demo

Here is the app appearance if a person speaks to user:

And here is app appearance if a person is not speaking (and can just move lips to mimic speaking):
